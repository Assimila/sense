# SenSE: Community SAR ScattEring model

SenSE is a generic community framework for radiative transfer (RT) modelling in the active microwave domain. It implements different existing models for scattering and emission for different surfaces in a coherent framework to simulate SAR backscattering coefficients as function of surface biogeophysical parameters.
